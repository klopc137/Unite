# Cookie Consent plugin for Craft CMS

Adds a cookie consent popup the complies with the cookie consent laws.

Uses the [Cookie Consent](https://cookieconsent.insites.com/download/) JavasScript library to show the popup.

## Installation

1. Download & unzip the repository and place the `craftcookieconsent` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git clone https://github.com/xkisu/craftcookieconsent.git` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
3.  -OR- install with Composer via `composer require xkisu/craftcookieconsent`
4. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
5. The plugin folder should be named `craftcookieconsent` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.

Craft Cookie Consent works on Craft 2.4.x and Craft 2.5.x.

## Configuring Cookie Consent

Either go to the plugin's install page and click on the settings cog next to the plugin entry, or go to the main settings page and click on `Cookie Consent` under the plugins sub-section.

As you update the settings a live preview of the cookie popup will change to show what it will look like to the end user.
